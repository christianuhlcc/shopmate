# AWS Deployment (Phase 10)

Production runs on a single EC2 instance (`t4g.small`, arm64, eu-central-1)
running the same compose stack as local dev, plus a production override for
ECR images and TLS. Decided 2026-07-12: cheapest option (~15 €/mo) that reuses
the verified `docker-compose.yml`; ECS/Fargate and App Runner were rejected
(cost / SSE timeout limits).

## Moving parts

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Infrastructure as code (ECR, IAM/OIDC, EC2, EIP, Route53, SSM config) | `deploy/terraform/` |
| Runtime secrets (JWT, DB password, Google OAuth, Dash0 token) | SSM Parameter Store `/shopmate/prod/*`, written by `deploy/aws/set-secrets.sh` |
| Observability (OTel Collector → Dash0: traces, metrics, logs, RUM) | `observability/otelcol.yaml`, collector service in `docker-compose.prod.yml` |
| CD workflow (build arm64 images → ECR → SSM Run Command) | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |
| On-instance deploy script (render `.env`, cert bootstrap, compose up) | `deploy/aws/deploy-on-instance.sh` |
| Production compose override (ECR images, TLS nginx, certbot renewal) | `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/nginx.prod.conf.template` |
| First-boot instance setup (docker, compose, swap, repo clone) | `deploy/terraform/user-data.sh` |

## How a deploy works

1. Push to `main` → CI runs (`ci.yml`).
2. CI success triggers the `Deploy` workflow (`workflow_run`); manual runs via
   `workflow_dispatch`. It assumes `shopmate-github-deploy` via **GitHub OIDC**
   — no AWS keys stored in GitHub; the role trusts only `main` of this repo.
3. Builds both images natively on an `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner (the instance
   is arm64), tags `:<sha>` + `:latest`, pushes to ECR.
4. Sends an **SSM Run Command** to the instance (no SSH): git-reset
   `/opt/shopmate` to the deployed sha, then `deploy-on-instance.sh <sha>`,
   which renders `.env` from Parameter Store, logs into ECR, pulls, and
   `compose up -d`. The workflow polls the command and fails if it fails.

## TLS

- First deploy: `deploy-on-instance.sh` issues the Let's Encrypt cert with
  certbot **standalone** (nginx can't start its 443 server without a cert).
- After that: the `certbot` sidecar renews via **webroot** through nginx's
  ACME location every 12 h; nginx reloads itself every 6 h to pick up renewed
  certs.
- HTTP redirects to HTTPS; HSTS is set.

## Operations

```bash
# All infra changes: edit deploy/terraform/, then
cd deploy/terraform && terraform plan && terraform apply

# Rotate/refresh secrets (Google creds re-read from ./.env; JWT/DB kept unless absent)
deploy/aws/set-secrets.sh

# Manual deploy of current main
gh workflow run Deploy

# Shell on the instance (no SSH keys — SSM Session Manager)
aws ssm start-session --target i-0fda569fb7ada49b5 --region eu-central-1

# Logs on the instance
cd /opt/shopmate && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f backend
```

Terraform state is **local** (`deploy/terraform/*.tfstate`, gitignored) — one
operator, one machine. Don't lose it; `terraform import` is the fallback.
Secrets are never in state: Terraform manages only non-secret parameters
(`DOMAIN`, `ECR_REGISTRY`, `CERTBOT_EMAIL`, `DASH0_ENDPOINT`).

## Observability (Dash0)

All three signals flow through an **OTel Collector sidecar** in the prod
compose stack (`observability/otelcol.yaml`); nothing is exported from local
dev.

- **Backend**: OTel Java agent (baked into the image, activated only by the
  prod `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`) — traces, JVM/HTTP metrics, and logback logs with
  trace correlation, as `shopmate-backend`.
- **Infra**: docker logs from nginx/postgres/certbot via the fluentd log
  driver (tag → `service.name`), host metrics via `/hostfs`, per-container
  metrics via the docker socket.
- **Frontend RUM**: `@dash0/sdk-web` (prod https only) sends to the same-origin
  `/telemetry/` path; nginx proxies it to the collector, which attaches the
  Dash0 auth token server-side — no token in the browser bundle.
- **Setup**: `DASH0_ENDPOINT` comes from Terraform (`dash0_endpoint` variable —
  must match the org's region, see app.dash0.com → Settings → Endpoints);
  `DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN` is an Ingesting-permission token written by
  `set-secrets.sh` (add it to `./.env` first). Both SSM parameters must exist
  before the next deploy, or `deploy-on-instance.sh` fails while rendering
  `.env`.

## Caveats / follow-ups

- **Google sign-in in prod** needs the redirect URI
  `https://shopmate.uhl-steine-scherben.org/login/oauth2/code/google`
  registered on the OAuth client in the Google Cloud console (same client as
  local dev). Until then the app loads but sign-in fails with
  `redirect_uri_mismatch`.
- **Postgres data** lives in a docker volume on the instance's EBS root
  volume. It survives stop/start and redeploys, but **not**
  `terraform destroy` / instance replacement. Set up EBS snapshots (DLM)
  before real household use.
- `DB_PASSWORD` must stay stable once postgres initialized its volume
  (`set-secrets.sh` never overwrites it).
- The account ID / role ARN in `deploy.yml` are hardcoded on purpose (public
  repo — they're not secrets; OIDC trust is scoped to this repo's `main`).
